      <h1>And now for something completely different</h1>
      <h4>Mon Oct 04 2010 01:00:00 GMT+0100 (BST)</h4>
      <div><p>Now this is a post all about how my life got flipped turned upside down. I&#39;d like to take a minute -- just sit right there -- I&#39;ll tell you how I became the Prince of a town called Bel Air.</p>
<p>In West Philadelphia, born and raised, on a playground is where I spent most of my days. Chillin&#39; out maxin&#39; relaxin&#39; all cool and all shootin&#39; some B Ball outside of the school when a couple of guys who were up to no good started making trouble in my neighbourhood. I got in one little fight and my Mom got scared, she said, &quot;You&#39;re moving with your Auntie and Uncle in Bel Air.&quot;</p>
<p>I whistled for a cab and when it came near the license plate said &quot;Fresh&quot; and it had dice in the morror. If anything I could say that this cab was rare, but I thought, &quot;Nah, forget it - yo, home to Bel Air&quot;.</p>
<p>I pulled up to then house about seven or eight and I yelled to the cabbie, &quot;Yo, Homes, smell ya later!&quot;, I looked at my kingdom. I was finally there to sit on my throne as the Prince of Bel Air.</p>
